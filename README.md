# react_native_redux_todo_app

This is an example of a todo app written with React Native using State Management with Redux. This is a counterpart for comparision with my other repo [https://github.com/roycechua23/react_native_redux_todo_app](https://github.com/roycechua23/react_native_redux_todo_app). You might want to check that out to if you want to see how redux can be implemented in a React Native app.
